#NP-Bypass
This Firefox extension is designed to get rid of "no participation" links on reddit.com.

There is minimal user interaction - no buttons or menus to worry about.  Just install the addon and "no participation" links won't bother you anymore.

###Examples:

https://np.reddit.com/r/sysadmin would become https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin.

np.reddit.com/r/programming would become www.reddit.com/r/programming.
