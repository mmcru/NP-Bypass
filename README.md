#NP-Bypass
This Firefox extension is designed to get rid of "no participation" links on reddit.com.

There is minimal user interaction - no buttons or menus to worry about.  Just install the addon and "no participation" links won't bother you anymore.

###Examples:

"https://np.reddit.com/r/sysadmin" would become "https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin".

"np.reddit.com/r/programming" would become "www.reddit.com/r/programming".
